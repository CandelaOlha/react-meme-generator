# ðŸ˜œ React Meme Generator

This project is part of [Scrimba's React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact), which I took to refresh some key React concepts.

## How it works

By using this website the user can get random meme images from an API and add top and bottom text.

## Knowledge applied

These are some of the topics I learned in this course and was able to apply in this meme generator:
- Event listeners
- State
- Conditional Rendering
- Forms
- Side effects
